    Final Project Proposal Submitted:
        We knew we wanted to do an RPG with a level/ Super Mario based format using miniGames such as tic-tac-toe, mancala, battleship, concentration (the hand-game), silo, go fish, poker, and some just up to chance. We wanted to use GUI to provide a visual for a player's progress on the map, based on their victories in miniGames.
